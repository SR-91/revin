                <p>
                    The institute recognises alumni who have distinguished themselves through their work and done the institute proud. The Distinguished Alumnus Awards have been instituted for this purpose. In addition to this, IIT Bombay has instituted the Distinguished Service awards for alumni who have rendered special services to the cause of the betterment of the institute. The institute also involves the alumni in its educational and research activities, whenever possible, by inviting them to participate on its advisory boards as visiting faculty or as guest speakers. Our alumni has responded whole-heartedly by supporting the institute with the most generous endowments, leading to the establishment of schools, laboratories, scholarships, chairs and various infrastructure developments. The office of the IITB Alumni Association is housed on the first floor of the Gulmohar Building. Alumni interact with the institute through the Alumni and Corporate Relations office.
